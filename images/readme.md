# Images Directory
## How to use

If you plan to include images in your site, upload them to this directory.

Then, in your HTML code, your image tag will be:

`<img src='images/NAME-OF-IMAGE' alt='Description of image' width="xxx" height="yyy" >`
<h2><img src="/Users/sidmohanty/Downloads/india-flag.jpeg" alt="India Flag" /></h2>
