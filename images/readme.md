# Images Directory
## How to use

If you plan to include images in your site, upload them to this directory.

Then, in your HTML code, your image tag will be:

<img src="https://s135.convertio.me/p/MM0J9DKIZNas_DIc2ZxZwg/59c114f1d09868e096d5c36ada4807a4/india-flag.jpeg" alt="India Flag" 
      style="height:100%">
